# Prediction future sales with ANNs

This repository tries to solve the task in the kaggle's competition [**Prediction Future Sales**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data) using artificial neural networks. This task consist in classify leaf samples in 99 differents species. There are images and features data for each leaf sample.

## Guideline

You can run each notebook in `Google Colab.` If you are in a local environment you have to install the `requirements.txt` packages and run the notebook `01 - Get data.ipynb.`

## Content

* **Notebook - 01:**Run if you are in a local environment to download and prepare the datasets necessary in the rest of notebooks.
* **Notebook - 02:**A data exploration of sales dataset. In this notebook you can explore the distributions and correlation of the data.
